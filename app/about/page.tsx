        My unique background, which spans from VR game development to neural networks, allows me to draw from a broad palette of tools and approaches to solve complex problems. This multi-disciplinary perspective, combined with a knack for continuous learning, equips me to adapt to evolving tech landscapes and always find the right tool for the task, whether it be traditional front-end technologies or state-of-the-art AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

        What sets me apart is my exceptional interpersonal skills, honed during my years as a tutor. This experience taught me to appreciate the diversity of thought processes and to communicate complex concepts in a straightforward manner. It has shaped my ability to work effectively in teams, liaise between technical and non-technical stakeholders, and articulate design and development decisions clearly.

    date: '2023-11-15',
    link: 'https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-mcguiness-react_reactjs-webdevelopment-frontenddevelopment-activity-7130657637385326592-z-08',

      <div className='flex flex-col gap-y-4'>
        <p>
          Recently, I started working with a new team at{' '}
          <a
            href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/applied-coding'
            target='_blank'
          >
            Applied Coding, Inc
          </a>{' '}
          and was introduced to a tool I hadn&apos;t used before -{' '}
          <a href='https://github.com/joe-bell/cva#readme' target='_blank'>
            Class Variance Authority (CVA)
          </a>
          . It&apos;s a straightforward and practical tool that simplifies
          managing styles. This not only makes my coding life easier but also
          leads to a cleaner, more user-friendly interface in the projects I
          work on.
        </p>
        <p>Here&apos;s a glimpse of how CVA works in a button component:</p>

        <Image
          src='/images/cva-code-1.png'
          width={0}
          height={0}
          sizes='100vw'
          className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-4xl'
          alt='Code to make a button with cva'
        />

        <p>
          In this snippet, buttonStyles utilizes CVA to create a flexible
          styling base. The variant property allows for easy toggling between
          styles like &apos;primary&apos; and &apos;secondary&apos;. This is
          particularly useful when you want to maintain consistency across
          various buttons while also providing unique styles where necessary.
        </p>

        <Image
          src='/images/cva-example.png'
          width={0}
          height={0}
          sizes='100vw'
          className='mx-auto h-20 w-auto'
          alt='Two buttons with Primary and Secondary styles'
        />

        <p>Now, let&apos;s compare this to the traditional approach:</p>

        <Image
          src='/images/cva-code-2.png'
          width={0}
          height={0}
          sizes='100vw'
          className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-4xl'
          alt='Code to make a button without cva'
        />

        <p>
          In the traditional method, we manually concatenate classes based on
          the variant prop, leading to more complex and less maintainable code.
          This approach can quickly become cumbersome, especially in larger
          projects with numerous components requiring various styles.
        </p>

        <h6>Key advantages of CVA:</h6>
        <ul className='list-disc ps-4'>
          <li>
            <span className='font-bold'>Simplicity in Variance:</span> Switching
            styles is as simple as changing the variant prop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className='font-bold'>Cleaner Codebase:</span> The styling
            logic is neatly encapsulated within buttonStyles, making the
            component structure more organized and readable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className='font-bold'>Scalability:</span> It&apos;s far
            simpler to add or modify styles with CVA, especially as project
            requirements evolve.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Have you worked with CVA before? What tools have you used to create
          style variants?

      'Turn the Corner on Your Web Design Skills with This CSS Page Fold Trick',
    date: '2023-10-31',
    link: 'https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-mcguiness-react_css-frontenddevelopment-webdevelopment-activity-7125279394880753664-o79O',
    content: (
      <div className='flex flex-col gap-y-4'>
        <p>
          I wanted to share this cool CSS trick I learned that gives the
          appearance of a page corner folding. This effect can increase visual
          interest by adding depth to the page, and it can also complement
          themes related to books, writing, or even vintage styles.
        </p>
        <Image
          src='/images/cutout-1.jpeg'
          width={0}
          height={0}
          sizes='100vw'
          className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-md'
          alt='Cutout effect'
        />

        <p>
          The basic idea is to use absolute positioning to place a square in the
          upper right corner of the page element.
        </p>
        <Image
          src='/images/cutout-2.jpeg'
          width={0}
          height={0}
          sizes='100vw'
          className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-md'
          alt='Full square without cutout'
        />

        <p>
          Then, we cut away half the square from the diagonal while cutting the
          same amount from the page element.
        </p>
        <Image
          src='/images/cutout-3.jpeg'
          width={0}
          height={0}
          sizes='100vw'
          className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-md'
          alt='Cutout effect showing diagonal'
        />

        <p>
          To do this, we need to know two things: the width/height of the square
          and the diagonal length.
        </p>
        <Image
          src='/images/cutout-4.jpeg'
          width={0}
          height={0}
          sizes='100vw'
          className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-md'
          alt='Cutout effect showing diagonal and width'
        />

        <p>
          Since we want the diagonal to cut the square in half, we can use some
          simple math to find that the width should be 1.4 times the diagonal
          length. For example, let&apos;s say we choose our diagonal to be 20
          pixels. That means the width would be 28 pixels.
        </p>

        <h6>Now, let&apos;s set the CSS properties:</h6>
        <ul className='list-disc ps-4'>
          <li>
            We&apos;ll create the cutout effect using a linear gradient with an
            abrupt transition from transparent to the page color.
          </li>
          <li>
            A default gradient moves from left to right, but we want it to move
            from the top right corner down and to the left. That&apos;s why we
            rotate the gradient 225 degrees.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the width/height of the class that we&apos;ll apply to the
            square.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Image
          src='/images/cutout-code-1.png'
          width={0}
          height={0}
          sizes='100vw'
          className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-4xl'
          alt='CSS code of cutout background linear gradient'
        />

        <Image
          src='/images/cutout-code-2.png'
          width={0}
          height={0}
          sizes='100vw'
          className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-4xl'
          alt='CSS code of corner fold'
        />

        <p>
          Don&apos;t forget to add some drop shadow to give it a feeling of
          depth! And there you have it - a cool page corner fold effect using
          CSS!
        </p>

        <p>
          ðŸ“Š In my project, I made variables for the square width and cutout
          diagonal so that I could adjust them from my component after the user
          hovers over the corner.{' '}

          alt='CSS code of corner fold'

          designs! Let me know if you have any questions. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š

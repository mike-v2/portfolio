        {`Holding my great grandfather's journals, a torrent of possibilities
          rushed through my mind. Visions of a digital sanctuary where these
          pages could come aliveâ€”searchable entries that users could revisit and
          bookmark, a space where every passage, every memory, every sentiment
          would be just a click away. I even dreamt of crafting a chatbot, a
          virtual echo of my great grandfather, brought to life through his own
          words and stories. The excitement was palpable, yet all these grand
          aspirations shared one foundational need: an accurate digital
          transcription of the decades-old text.`}

        Challenge: Accurate Transcription of Handwritten Journals

        {`The elegance of my great grandfather's cursive posed a surprising
          obstacle. While today it seems like AI can do anything, transcription
          AIs faltered before this challenge. Initial attempts with Google
          Vision API yielded disappointing results. I was confident I was on the
          right track but felt like I hit a wall. The AI had an accuracy rate of
          just 64% - nowhere near precise enough for preserving family history.`}

      <Header2>The Solution</Header2>
      <p>
        I noticed that sometimes Google Vision would mix words from different
        lines. But what if I could make the AI focus on one line at a time? With
        this in mind, I turned to{' '}
        <Anchor href='https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch'>
          CRAFT AI
        </Anchor>
        . By identifying and isolating individual lines of text, I hoped to
        present clearer data for Google Vision to interpret.
      </p>

      <p>First, I used CRAFT AI to identify each word:</p>
      <Image
        src='/images/ocrPost/boxes-short.jpg'
        width={0}
        height={0}
        sizes='100vw'
        className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-2xl'
        alt='Journal entry with boxes around each word'
      />
      <p>
        Using some python algorithms, I could use the CRAFT boxes to identify
        the boundaries of each line
      </p>
      <Image
        src='/images/ocrPost/lines-short.jpg'
        width={0}
        height={0}
        sizes='100vw'
        className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-2xl'
        alt='Journal entry with lines separating each line of text'
      />

      <p>
        Then I could make a new image from each line, starting with the first
        line:
      </p>
      <Image
        src='/images/ocrPost/line-1.jpg'
        width={0}
        height={0}
        sizes='100vw'
        className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-2xl'
        alt='The first line of a journal entry'
      />
      <p>Then the second line:</p>
      <Image
        src='/images/ocrPost/line-2.jpg'
        width={0}
        height={0}
        sizes='100vw'
        className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-2xl'
        alt='The second line of a journal entry'
      />
      <p>And third (and so on...)</p>
      <Image
        src='/images/ocrPost/line-3.jpg'
        width={0}
        height={0}
        sizes='100vw'
        className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-2xl'
        alt='The third line of a journal entry'
      />

        className='mx-auto h-auto w-full max-w-2xl'
        alt='String comparison tool showing 85.7% similarity'
      />
      <p>
        {`The proof was in the transcription. A comparison of the AI's results
          using the entire page versus individual lines showed a remarkable
          improvement. From a mediocre 64%, accuracy soared to a commendable 86%
